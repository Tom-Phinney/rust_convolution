# rust_convolution

A simple 2d convolution in Rust, as fast as possible! 

This is a collection of suggested Rust functions that were proposed as solutions to matching the performance of C.
The suggestions come from respondents to a question on the Rust user forum: "Rust performance help (convolution)"
: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/rust-performance-help-convolution/44075

The problem is a simple 500-element convolution kernel run over a 20-million-element data set. See convolution.c in the top-level directory.

The Rust solutions are each held in modules named after their contributor on the above forum thread.

## Build and Run

Build and run is a program that times the various solutions for the 20-million-element convolution and prints the results:
```
    $ git clone https://github.com/ZiCog/rust_convolution/edit/master/README.md
    $ cd rust_convolution
    $ cargo run --release
```

Or run the benchmarks, which use a much smaller kernel and data set:
```
    $ cargo bench
```

## Results

The full convolution produces times like these on my Intel PC:

## Commentary:

1) Many people suggested different Rust "functional" style approaches to this problem, some of them involving use of "unsafe". It turns out that for single-thread performance the normal procedural style I wrote na√Øvely from the C example is the fastest by a wide margin. Beware of those who suggest functional style and/or "unsafe" to get performance in Rust; it is not always true!

2) The fastest "functional" style solution, by @alice, matches my procedural effort. It is also pure poetry. So short, sweet and to the point compared to all the others.

3) For multi-core parallelism @alice's functional style wins hands down. Also, it only required a 4-character change to the source to parallelize it!

4) The parallel solution is painfully slow on small data sets, as shown in the benchmark figures.
